Summer is coming - game work in progress

Pretty much what it is, personal project to get familiar with Phaser. Quick build 4 days from design layout to logic from ground up; Still quite a few bugs, reel array logic to be reviewed, bank management to be finished, jackpot pop winning celebration to be integrated with particule system.

Got side track on another project will get back to it soon! :)
